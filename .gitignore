/app/assets/images/mosaic-*.png
# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore some yml files
/config/application.yml

# Ignore jetty
/jetty

#ignore uploads
/public/uploads

# Ignore mosaic images and mosaic sprite
# generated by compass.
app/assets/images/mosaic-*
app/assets/images/mosaic/*.*
