# Openvault

## Overview

[Openvault](http://openvault.wgbh.org) is Rails/Hydra application which makes available to the public
most of the metadata for WGBH media assets, and a small selection of our media.

### Related projects

**Boston TV News Digital Library**: 
([site](http://bostonlocaltv.org) [github](https://github.com/WGBH/bostonlocaltv))
Footage from WGBH's *Ten O'Clock News* is here, along with footage from other area broadcasters.
(It's probably more difficult than it ought to be for people on Openvault to discover the News site.)

**PBCore**: ([docs](http://pbcore.org/)) An XML standard for public broadcasting metadata.
This is what we store in Fedora. You shouldn't need to worry about the details: access is 
provided through `PbcoreDescDoc` which extends `ActiveFedora::OmDatastream`.

**Blog**:
([site](http://blog.openvault.wgbh.org/) [config github](https://github.com/WGBH/openvault-blog))
In the earlier version of the site, all of wordpress was checked in to this codebase.
Now it's its own site, with just the configuration tweaks to the default installation checked in.
The downside is that nothing is keeping the style in sync between these two sites.

**Media server**:
You shouldn't need to worry about the media server, except to note that it blocks requests from
hosts it hasn't white-listed. For development, if you actually want to see media, add
"`127.0.0.1  localhost.wgbh.org`" to your `/etc/hosts`

**Digital Commonwealth**:
([site](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/))
They (hopefully) harvest our content via OAI-PMH. They are interested only is media, and not in
our "Program" or "Series" records.

## Operations

### Deploy

`cap -S branch=development staging deploy`

### Ingest

`rake openvault:ingest ...`

You'll need to specify a PBCore file to ingest, and set a mode to control handling of conflicts.

### Debug

On the server:

- Consult the logs.
- Look at the PBCore for a record: append `.pbcore` to any URL.
- Look at the Solr result for a record: append `.solr` to any URL.
- As a *last* resort, the files can be tweaked live, but it's under Passenger, to recompile isn't automatic.

Locally:

- rspec
- byebug

## Internals

### `routes.rb`

- There are a lot of adhoc redirects so that old references we found with webmaster tools don't break.
- Any URL which isn't matched by anything more specific falls through to the `OverrideController`

### `controllers/`

At the heart of a Blacklight application is the `CatalogController`.
The most important tweak in ours is `#lookup_and_set_fields` which allows items to be found by a slug we've assigned.

### `models/`

*TODO*

### `views/`

*TODO*
