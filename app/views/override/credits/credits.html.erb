    <p>The creation of Open Vault: WGBH Media Library and Archives Web site was made possible through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Any views, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this website do not necessarily represent those of the IMLS.</p>

    <p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) further funded the development of Open Vault in 2008, with the addition of the Vietnam Collection. Subsequent lessons learned from Open Vault Research, funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, helped inform the later design and functionality of Open Vault Vietnam.</p>
