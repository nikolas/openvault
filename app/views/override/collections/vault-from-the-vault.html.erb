    <p>The steel shelves of the WGBH vault hold six decades of radio and television programs, an exuberant collection of finished shows and outtakes, successes and missteps, all stored at a constant, cool 62 degrees. “From the Vault,” launched in 2011, is an ongoing collaboration with WGBH Radio (89.7), and WGBH.org, bringing treasures from the archive to new audiences, when rights permit.</p>
    <p>While most of the Open Vault collections are designed for scholarly research, “From the Vault” is meant for a wider viewership. Selections to date give a sense of the range of the WGBH collection, from a rare, unedited 1990 interview with Steve Jobs, to interviews with Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and James Baldwin for a 1963 program called “The Negro and the American Promise,” a 1967 film featuring Dr. Timothy Leary making the case for LSD, and clips from the first ZOOM series in the early 1970s.</p>
    <p>Check back with us from time to time to see what new gems we’ve brought off the shelves and back out into the world.</p>
