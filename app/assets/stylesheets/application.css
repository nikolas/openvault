/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Require a single the file to @import all other scss files.
 * NOTE: Multiple SCSS files required by this manifest cannot share methods or variables.
 *  So we require a single scss file that then @imports several more into the same namespace.
 *= require scss_imports
