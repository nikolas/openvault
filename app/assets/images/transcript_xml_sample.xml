                        Park. Our question today poses a choice between two conflicting policies or
                        philosophies of Park management: one which leans toward preservation and the
                        other which leans toward use. Supporting the proposal that public use of our
                        national parks should be restricted is Advocate Howard Miller.</seg></u>

                        Thank you. Our national parks are being destroyed, not by man, but by the
                        automobile and by developers of expensive resorts. It is time to save these
                        national parks and, by so doing, to save ourselves. With me to support
                        today's proposal for preservation is biologist Garrett Hardin, Professor of

                        should be more facilities for the American people to enjoy their parks
                        instead of less. My witnesses are Don Hummel, who heads the park concession

                        you shortly, but first let me give you some background on the setting for
                        our debate today.</seg><seg xml:id="para6" smil:begin="00:02:56.423"
                        smil:end="00:03:16.597">Yosemite National Park covers over three quarters of
                        a million acres; it's located in central California on the Nevada/California
                        border. Most of it is wilderness, accessible only to hikers and campers and
                        climbers. Over two million people visit the park yearly but the vast
                        majority of them confine their activities to Yosemite Valley, which is where
                        we are now.</seg><seg xml:id="para7" smil:begin="00:03:16.597"
                        smil:end="00:04:45.335">In the summer, in the words of one observer, "The
                        valley is crowded with people, cars, trailers, camper vehicles, tents,
                        cabins, sleeping bags, people. " And as well as the natural scenic delights,
                        visitors to Yosemite Village and its surroundings may enjoy such amenities
                        as a Pitch and Putt golf course, a swimming pool, tennis courts, a kennel,
                        barber and beauty shops, a luxury hotel, restaurant and a cocktail lounge.
                        Is this what our national parks were meant for? Some people don't think so
                        and, earlier this year, the Conservation Foundation published a report
                        entitled "National Parks For The Future". It looked at the growing use of
                        our national parks and the impact of that use on our parks themselves and it
                        concluded that it was time to adopt a new policy for our national park
                        system, one that would have the effect of restricting public use in these
                        parks. Specifically, it recommended that automobiles be phased out of the
                        parks; that in-park campgrounds should be limited to rustic settings and
                        structures and provide for camping only in tents; that mechanized camping
                        should be provided for outside-of-park boundaries; that luxury facilities,
                        the golf courses and the restaurants, the cocktail lounges and the like,
                        also should be prohibited inside park boundaries; and that park facilities
                        now managed by private concessionaires be turned over for management by
                        non-profit corporations, and it's the sum of these recommendations that
                        constitutes the meaning of the question, which we're going to be debating
                        today.</seg><seg xml:id="para8" smil:begin="00:04:45.335"
                        smil:end="00:05:07.565">Please bear in mind that these proposals do not
                        necessarily mean that the numbers of people using our national parks be
                        reduced. They  will, however, significantly change the character of what you
                        can do when  you get there. Should the use of our national parks be
                        restricted? That's  the question before us and, Mr. Miller, the meadow is
                        yours.</seg></u>

                        convenience, inside the park. Of course, we can develop hotels right outside
                        the park. People can come in in their mini-buses, but here, inside the park,

                        Roughly, it's rather sad. Over the past fifty years, the development has
                        been largely one of replacement of people by automobiles. And I think it's

                        Yes, It's not as true now as it was two years ago. Two years ago, it reached
                        a crisis situation, with immense traffic jams, smog and so on. The last
                        couple of years, the public has been persuaded to a certain extent to leave
                        their cars behind, come in and take advantage of the mini-buses and, as a
                        result, it's been more pleasurable by all accounts to be here now with more

                        This is a very important point and I'm going to take some time explaining.
                        In economics, there is a famous law, known as "Gresham's Law" which, simply
                        put, says "bad money drives out good. " If you allow free competition
                        between counterfeit and real money, the counterfeit displaces the real
                        money. So we don't allow free competition. We say freedom has to end at that
                        point.</seg><seg xml:id="para26" smil:begin="00:09:20.327"

                        "Hardin's Law of The Environment, " And that is that destruction drives out
                        gentleness. That if one person wants to have a rock concert and another
                        person wants to play his recorder, only the man who wants the rock concert
                        gets his way because we can't hear a recorder when there's a rock band
                        playing. In the same way, the automobile drives out walkers, drives out
                        bicycling. The motorboat drives out canoes. Motorboats drive out swimming.
                        They run at high speeds and so on. Always the more destructive use drives
                        out the gentler use and the only way you can prevent the automatic working
                        out of this tragedy is to rule out of a small percentage of the country,
                        like the national parks, rule out the more destructive uses so the gentler
                        uses can have their way.</seg></u>

                        is this season. It cannot be locked up as a museum treasure. " Would you

                        I think that Ansell Adams was comparing Yosemite with the recent past, in
                        spite of his saying fifty-four years. I think if you went back a hundred
                        years, you'd find Yosemite doesn't look as good as it did then. But, it does
                        look much better than it did two years ago and that, naturally, gives him
                        hope, partly because there are fewer people coming to Yosemite than there
                        were two years ago.</seg></u>

                        in, are you willing, sir, to let them have modest hotel accommodations so
                        they can stay here in the valley, or does everybody have to backpack and

                        entire country. This is all we've got. You begin to ask for ten percent of
                        this. You're asking for ten percent of all we've got. The important thing is
                        that all we've got is only this infinitesimal amount. And what about the old
                        people - this misuse of people who we disregard and then use as an excuse to
                        spoil this environment. They can stay outside the park in a hotel and come

                        the center of the park instead of just outside, are we going to ruin the
                        experience, not for the people in the high country, but for everyone else in
                        the valley. God has created this valley, but only we can preserve

                        Thank you, Mr. Miller. For those of you at home who may have joined us late,
                        we've been debating here in Yosemite National Park the question of park

                        of our national parks. Now, we're going to turn to Mr. Julber who's going to
                        take the opposite side of that question. Mr. Julber?</seg></u>

                        Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we're standing here in the most
                        beautiful valley in the world. For over one hundred years, Americans have
                        come here to see "Half-Dome" and all the other wonders of Yosemite, They've
                        come here in horse carts, wagons, steam locomotives, Model "T's", Model
                        "A's" and now they come in campers, trailers and motor homes. And suddenly
                        we're told you must not come here in this manner anymore. This park will no
                        longer be for the use and enjoyment of all our people. It must be set aside
                        for a hiking aristocracy, the way European aristocracy used to set aside
                        vast hunting preserves from which the common people were excluded. I don't
                        believe that any small group should have the right to take over our national
                        parks and no small group, no matter how well intentioned, has the right to
                        impose by law their choice of a life style on the American people. My first
                        witness is Mr. Don Hummel, Mr. Hummel. Have your turn on the stump, Mr.

                        development for use of ninety-nine percent of the people. In other words,
                        one-eighth of one percent is set aside for the great majority of the use of

                        That's very novel, but you create more problems than you solve because once

                        to come in in the morning, everybody has to go out in the evening, so you
                        have a commuter type of traffic condition. You lose control of what services

                        We limit everyone. Let's talk about the park service's recommendation for
                        Yellowstone. The park service has a general philosophy and now it is
                        recommended for Yellowstone, cut out the cars, what they call wilderness
                        check facilities, take down the massive hotels and open up Yellowstone to
                        the way you say it could not be seen. Do you disagree with that

                        Well, because there's a lot of people that believe that way, but there's
                        more people that believe the other way. You'll find that out before this

                        But, isn't one of the reasons there's more people is because we've excluded

                        hear the traffic? Maybe the cameras aren't picking it up. You know what this
                        traffic sounds like in July? Do you know how many people are going down the
                        Merced River on their rafts in July? You can't get into the river because
                        you're bumped out. Is that an enjoyment of Yosemite Valley?</seg></u>

                        Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the traffic that you just heard was a
                        snow plow coming up from Wawona and the smog that was referred to earlier is
                        the campfire smoke, campfire smoke that is here in summer because there are
                        a lot of people camping here including a lot of backpackers and people in
                        tents, and they want to burn wood campfires. I'm from Los Angeles and I know
                        what smog smells like, Campfire smoke smells good. Now you, you ladies and
                        gentlemen, not those right here, but those in the listening audience. You've
                        often been told that you should get out and see your national parks. Well,
                        take my advice and do it very, very soon because you can see right now, from
                        this program, that there are people in this country who are soon going to
                        severely restrict your use of the parks. And these people happen to be a
                        very well organized political lobby and they're not just kidding when they
                        see that they want to restrict your use of the parks. They already have
                        ninety-seven percent of the park areas for their exclusive use. And I know
                        what I'm talking about because I was a backpacker once, too.</seg><seg
                        xml:id="para347" smil:begin="00:54:41.593" smil:end="00:55:29.438">What they
                        want to do is cut down on your access to the very last one percent or three
                        percent. In Yosemite, it's one percent, here in the valley where the
                        American public can come. Now, I don't feel that we should let any small
                        group in our country take over our national parks and w hen one small group
                        has the exclusive use of ninety-seven percent of Yellowstone or ninety-nine
                        percent of Yosemite, that small group has taken over the park. No one small
                        group in our country should impose their life style on another by law. Sure,
                        talk to people. Try to get them to backpack. Tell them the glories of
                        hiking, but don't impose those standards by law. In a democratic society,
                        every person has his own freedom of choice.</seg></u>

                        Mr. Julber, I'm going to have to break in at that point. We have to go to

                        Mr. Julber has these endless amounts of time to explain what his position
                        is. Let's see who this small political group is. My God! In favor of this
                        proposal, we have one of the world's leading biologists, and a man who
                        climbed Mt. Everest. And against it an executive who runs concessions and
                        the former head of the Bureau of Reclamation. Now I understand the positions
                        of those men, but I don't think this program indicates any small
                        conspiratorial, spiritual or other group. It's simply people who want to
                        save Yosemite Valley. If we can't save Yosemite Valley. If we can't save our
                        other parks, we can't save anything. If we can, we have a chance. We can
                        begin to save these things.</seg><seg xml:id="para350"

                        will tell us what we are. That's why we say, and why we've always said, that
                        in preserving this valley, we are not simply preserving a human experience
                        that cannot otherwise be duplicated, we are indeed preserving ourselves.

                        to express your views on what you think our national park system should be.
                        The national park system was a triumph of democratic ideals in America and,
                        in the future, it should be no less so. Should public use of our national
                        parks be drastically restricted? That's the question. Please send us your
                        yes or no vote on a letter or postcard to "The Advocates", Box 1972, Boston
                        02134. We'll tabulate your views and make them known to the members of
                        Congress, to the White House, to the Secretary of the Interior and to the
                        Director of the National Park Service, all the people who are going to have
                        make these important decisions in the coming months and years. So remember
