                        indicates "Joyce Chen Cooks" and then "Egg Foo Yung." A subsequent title
                        gives us Chinese lettering and the translation "How are you?" To the right
                        of the chimes we see Chen and the camera, without any cutting, moves in on
                        her at the kitchen counter. Chen welcomes the viewer, explains that the
                        Chinese words offer the "How are you?" salutation, and declares that her
                        goal is to "encourage you to do more cooking." Today, she explains, she will
                        show how to make Egg Foo Yung that is comparable to restaurant-style fare
                        but that can be done easily at home. First, she will make the sauce. As she
                        pours the first ingredient, chicken broth, into a pot, we get the very first
                        cut in the episode -- to a close-up of her hands doing the pouring -- and
                        the episode will now regularly alternate long shots of Chen explaining the
                        process and close-ups of her hands doing this or that specific task in
                        preparation of the recipe.  One ingredient she
                        singles out in her Egg Foo Yong sauce is ketchup, which she admits is not a
                        "native Chinese ingredient" but which fits the Western palate and its
                        penchant for sweetness in savory dishes (she notes that ketchup is
                        particularly useful in adding color and flavor to sweet-and-sour Chinese
                        dishes).  After finishing the sauce, Chen repeats
                        the ingredients out loud. She shows off the sauce in close-up and explains
                        that it looks very much "like the gravy you are served with your roasted
                        turkey or roasted beef." Here, then, we witness -- as we often will in
                        Chen's series -- a desire to make seemingly exotic Chinese cuisine familiar
                        to U.S. audiences by comparing the foreign element to ostensibly comparable
                        American fare.  Chen now announces she will make the
                        Egg Foo Yung itself and the camera follows her as she moves to another part
                        of her kitchen to do so. The preparation for Egg Foo Yung, as she explains
                        it, starts with five eggs unbeaten, and she notes that eggs are an easy,
                        inexpensive, and nutritious ingredient: in this respect, again, her
                        preparation of a somewhat foreign dish invests in the values common in
                        postwar American cooking instruction where there was often an emphasis on
                        health and economy along with the need to impress family and guests through
                        fare that seemed a bit exotic, yet not too much so.  Chen explains that in China, at the birth of a new child, eggs are dyed red
                        and sent out as a sort of birth announcement: the quantity of eggs will
                        indicate the degree of wealth in the family and the evenness or oddness of
                        the number of eggs indicates whether the newborn is a boy or a girl. The
                        color red indicates good luck and, in general, eggs are a harbinger of good
                        things to come, so Egg Foo Yung is a symbolically resonant dish.  One ingredient to be added to the mixture is bean sprouts and
                        Chen shows off fully grown sprouts as well as seeds, promising in a future
                        episode to show viewers how to grow their own sprouts. Once again showing
                        concern for American tastes and for accessibility of ingredients in the U.S.
                        market, Chen explains that for sprouts one can substitute lettuce chopped in
                        strips to approximate the shape of sprouts.  She
                        adds in other ingredients such as salt -- which she spells out letter by
                        letter -- and MSG and sherry. Notably, these ingredients are in containers
                        labeled with the generic name (i.e., just "SHERRY" or "MSG") and no brand
                        names visible. Here, Chen's show continues the practice of Julia Child's The
                        French Chef, which, as a program on public television, worked to eschew any
                        sense of product placement or promotion.  Once she
                        has finished mixing the Egg Foo Yung, Chen announces that she will repeat
                        the ingredients and holds up a list in Chinese characters. A dissolve takes
                        us to a closer shot of Chinese figurines (wise men, it would seem), each of
                        which has a small label with an ingredient on it. The camera pans over these
                        to sum up all the ingredients that we have just seen combined to make up the
                        batter.  Chen puts the batter into oil on an
                        electric griddle pan, and while the mixture cooks, she offers some
                        background to Chinese cooking history. In particular, the difficulty of
                        transportation across regions meant that Chinese cooking tended to stay
                        local and developed thereby into four primary regional schools: Mandarin or
                        Peking, Shanghai, Cantonese, and Szechuan. Chen promises to offer more
                        detailed instruction on the various cuisine in upcoming episodes of her
                        show.  Chen now plates up the cooked dish and
                        declares how good it smells. "I hope some day you will come here to eat with
                        us," she offers. She puts the Egg Fu Yung and its sauce on a tray which she
                        carries across the threshold of the kitchen into a somewhat abstracted
                        dining space: an octagonal table with modernist chairs surrounded by lattice
                        work and no visible walls. Rice is already on the table and she dishes out
                        portions of the Egg Fu Yung. (Unlike in Child's The French Chef, she does no
                        tasting of her dish and doesn't mime the presence of the viewer as a diner
                        at her table.) She promises to "See you again" and the words for that appear
                        in Chinese and English. The camera pans to the wind chimes that we saw at
                        the very beginning and the credits come on the screen one after the other. A
                        voiceover tells us that Chen is also the author of the published volume, The
                        Joyce Chen Cookbook.</seg></u>
