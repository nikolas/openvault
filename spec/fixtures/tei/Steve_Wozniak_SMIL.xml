                        good enough for me. It had to be interesting enough that I could show it off. And it didn't
                        have to be somehow a set of definitions that has to do this much, have that many memories, run
                        at that speed. Be able to do these kind of calculations on this type of printer. Didn't have to
                        do these things... So I was, I was not designing a computer with any idea we'd ever start a
                        company, ever have a product, ever be successful. It was just to go down to the club and show
                        off, and to own and to use. I used it at work to run some calculations for the calculator chips
                        I was designing. I'd run it right there on my desk and I was impressing quite a few people. They
                        would come by, engineers would come by my desk. After Hewlett-Packard had turned me down for
                        doing it as a product, they'd come by and say this is the most incredible product I've ever
                        seen. So they could recognize it was great but they couldn't come up with a reason that
                        Hewlett-Packard could make it. And I was I just had to satisfy myself. It had to be
                        interesting. It had to be able to...to show it off and so it was, it was lucky that it was
                        good, but it was that the world wanted something that good.</seg>

                        my own head. Once I was designing these products for a company although I'd gone there saying
                        I'd just like to design these products, I can do that and show them off at the club, I was now
                        part of a company and we were in business. And a lot of, Mike Markkula was very, very strong. He
                        was the businessman. He said the company should be run by marketing. All great companies are.
                        That marketing has to go out and sort of sense what a market wants and come back to engineering
                        and you know work with engineering in a give and take sense of what can you build that would
                        satisfy these needs of our customers. He was very adamant at that and that's the sort of company
                        Apple became because he was in charge. A hacker would have sat there and said, we can do
                        this neat thing with technology. I learned this in school. Here's a product idea I got, and
                        there'd be a lot of randomness and not so much concern for the customer. And Apple really
                        really started changing and becoming more mature in a sense but less of, less of a hacker's
                        world. There were a lot of them out there and we...we serviced a lot of their needs for awhile,

                        features for the same price from other companies. And this was sort of always a perception of
                        IBM. You know I don't how accurate it is but a lot of, one of our goals in the home brew

                        available. It's cheap. Even even eight year olds can sit down and write great programs. And

                        into just normal electronics back then. This is before integrated circuits. And my father
                        somehow would pass me a book from work on programming and I couldn't understand it, maybe
                        in about 4th grade. Didn't make any sense but by junior high school, he showed me a book
                        from back in the late '50s, you know, the, some computers that they had designed, some articles
                        about them. And I read these articles with fascination, how they used oscilloscope screens that,
                        that showed patterns of light, how they could use that to store information like memories,
                        very little information in today's terms but I read these articles and I started picking up
                        computer concepts. And I found it interesting at first. And later on, I started, I got a book on
                        Boolean algebra and this was, I was good at math, this was algebra. I studied it and learned how
                        to do calculations and by 8th grade built a really great science fair project- I built a few
                        computer projects even in elementary school for science fairs to show off things that could, you
                        know, like, I learned the concepts of how you would build a machine to play tic-tac-toe. And I
                        nearly built one on a big piece of plywood with nails pounded in and transistors that a local
                        company gave me, Fairchild gave me 400 transistors and diodes free, to build a project. And, I,
                        I soldered all these transistors to the post and I didn't quite get it working but by 8th grade
                        I built a working computer element, an adder, subtracter in binary, built it out of transistors
                        because this was before chips were affordable. And it was just out of interest. It wasn't
                        like I got graded, graded on it. I didn't have any friends that did it. I didn't do it for,
                        cause I had a group of computer people. Did it all alone. I don't know why. It was, I knew when
                        I was doing it, it was like, I'm solving crossword puzzles in a sense. I would dream computers
                        and wake up with a solution in the middle of the night. And I learned after a while I might
                        forget it so I'd write them down- And it was like that all through my childhood. By the end of
                        high school I learned how real computers, the computers from the new company Digital had
                        the PDP-8. The small computer handbook was one of the key manuals in those days that taught me a
                        lot about computers. Ahro, my electronics teacher arranged, arranged for me to go down to a
                        local company and program computers every Friday because we didn't have computers in high
                        schools back then. It was just a lot of, a lot of factors. I was always interested and
                        always going in that direction when the opportunity arose. Even when I got to college in 1968
                        there were, there were probably no universities that had computers as an undergraduate
                        curriculum. And I went to the University of Colorado and I simply took a graduate course. You
                        know, didn't matter I was a freshman. That was my interest. Got my A plus but I also got put on
                        probation for computer abuse cause I ran too many programs. </seg>

                        my first year of college. I got in the habit of getting manuals for all the mini-computers that
                        companies were producing. I would study those computers and then I got all the latest manuals
                        from the Silicone Valley companies making better and better chips. So, I'd always get the latest
                        manual and design the computers. I, there were several of my favorite computers that I liked to
                        design over and over and over and get my designs better and better and better, meaning fewer
                        parts. And I, I tried to get local companies, like Fairchild, to give me some chips. If you can
                        give me this many chips I can build a computer and they kept sort of promising me some rejects
                        and nothing ever came through until it was my second year of college, I believe, and a
                        local company did give me some chips, Signetics gave me a bunch of chips. And I designed a
                        computer of my own. I thought up, I had taken classes and one of the things you do in computer
                        classes is you, what is the very smallest instruction set that can make a complete computer?
                        And, I was real good at that one, but solving it. But I still designed a very tiny
                        computer that had few instructions, that did everything you needed to do, it did a lot. It was a
                        computer and it was my own. It was almost no chips, almost, just about 20 chips was all. So I
                        got them from Signetics and a friend and I wired it up in his garage. I designed it. We wired it
                        up every night for about a week in his garage and we would drink cream soda late into night
                        cause we weren't even Coke drinkers back then and Bill Fernandez and I and got it done and
                        working. And we showed it off. And a local paper even came and took some pictures of it and it,
                        it was really a computer and it ran and computed. </seg>

                        like terminals. And I had just designed a terminal cause I did a lot of side projects. And a
                        friend of mine told me, this club is for people interested in terminals and things. He didn't
                        tell me it was a microprocessor club or I would have been afraid to go because for about
                        three years I'd drifted away from computers. I hadn't followed microprocessors. I didn't think
                        they were going to be worth much. I was designing calculators for Hewlett-Packard, doing side
                        projects with video tape recorders and building my own terminals, you know, just at night-time.
                        But I didn't know what microprocessors were. And I went to this meeting and I was kind of
                        shocked that everybody knew about these computers were coming out and affordable prices,
                        microprocessors were here. And I was scared to death that I was in the wrong place. And I just
                        thought, I didn't want to let anything on. I'll just sort of sit and listen. And I listened a
                        lot that night and heard a lot of interesting things and it really changed my life, got
                        re-interested in computers once I found out microprocessors were just like the mini-computers
                        that I used to design. </seg>

                        might equate to like $800, $1,000 of today's dollars. But there was some little, tiny computer,
                        256 bytes of memory. It was basically what I had built for my cream soda computer but it was now
                        being sold at affordable prices. And there were a bunch of people that wanted to buy it, you
                        know. They didn't have the, very much money yet cause all the people at the Homebrew Computer
                        Club, throughout its entire existence, were just low level technical sorts that don't have
                        any spare money. It takes you a year to save a thousand dollars. And I, it was it was
                        a real, real experience for me to discover that so many people knew about this computer and
                        they're talking about floppy discs coming out for it. And some people had visited the factory
                        and they saw it being manufactured and the software basic was taking off like hotcakes with all
                        these games, game programs. You could play games on it. And every time, for any company that had
                        computers, if you went to the company's open house, they'd set up their computers in a row,
                        playing games. It was like a typical way to show off a computer and now you could have your own.

                        was real obvious. These computers were so inexpensive for what they did, so popular among

                        programmers, we could kind of write a program for a computer for our company but we had to give
                        it to them to run on their computer. We were denied access to the computer in a lot of ways. And
                        yet this was the thing we had grown up to love. When I was in, in high school, I told my father
                        that some day, back then the mini-computer with 4K RAM cost as much as a house. I told my
                        father, I've decided that some day I'm going to have an apartment instead of a house and I'm
                        going to buy myself a computer. I'm going to be the one person that owns a computer in the
                        world. And a lot of us had really made that decision. We wanted a computer but our company owned
                        it. We would sneak time, there was one friend that went to the Homebrew Computer Club with me
                        and in earlier years when we were both at a local community college, he had a key and he, we'd
                        use the key and we'd go in at midnight and we'd sit there for two hours running programs with
                        cards on this IBM computer and then sneak back out. You just wanted as much access as you could
                        get to the computer because that's how you could learn more. And we all wanted our own computers
                        and finally we were going to be able to have our computer and it wasn't our company's computer.
                        And we were going to be able to use that tool. With so much of our free time, we'd be able to do
                        more than their programmers could anyway. </seg>

                        meeting. There were only 40 of us that met in a garage. God knows why. The thing that spurred it
                        was a cover, cover article on Popular Electronics Magazine that showed a picture of the Altair
                        computer, kind of the first computer you could buy. It wasn't really a computer, it was a kit,
                        meaning you had to be electronic and there were only 40 of us. But the club, even for that type
                        of club, technical people, see, our, our only, the only thing we had in common was, we all had
                        to be a little bit strange. We were all interested in technology or something pertaining to
                        strange types of people, strange things going on in the world, strange diets, strange clothing,
                        strange ways of doing things, you know. There were probably very few people in there that
                        had a credit card. I don't, so, it was unusual for that, that, those type of people to grow
                        over a year to maybe 500 of us meeting every two weeks. But it's like we were all there, just
                        listening to every word. A lot of us were very shy, like myself, afraid to, I never raised my
                        hand and offered something to the club. Occasionally I'd submit an article of a clever program I
                        had written or something to the club journal cause we wanted to pass around good things. And I
                        would haul down my TV set from home, hook it up and show off the computer every two weeks, even
                        the Apple II, showing it off while it was being developed. You never heard of a successful
                        product being treated that way by a company because they'd be afraid, well, other people seeing
                        it is going to stop us from being able to sell it. Well, here's a case where it obviously
                        didn't. And a lot of people would look at it and not quite be sure that we were going to go
                        anywhere even without the Apple II. But boy, I, I don't know, those, it's just hard, anyone
                        who was a part of the Homebrew Computer Club, it just, it's the sort of thing that existed once
                        in your life and may never exist again cause it was that was the big excitement. We were
                        hearing what companies were coming out with what products. Some people were offering to sell RAM
                        chips at a certain low price or talking about a new product they were working on or some
                        other company was going to introduce. I mean, some of it was flaky rumors and some of it was
                        good rumors. But, you loved to hear it. </seg>

                        think $400 or $600 back then, but you had to pay another $600 to buy the basic language on paper
                        tape. And we had a copy in our club library. And anyone who wanted, could borrow it, even though
                        only about ten of us had computers after a year they could borrow the tape and run it. But
                        then somebody brought it back with a couple extra copies. I think it was my friend, Dan Sokol,
                        brought it back with a couple extra copies and said, anybody can take the tapes but if you do,
                        please bring back more than you took. And it brought a stern letter from Microsoft or
                        whoever, from MITS themselves, the company making the computer but it turned into Microsoft.
                        Bill Gates was the, the author of that language and he's the one who founded Microsoft. They
                        came out with a stern letter, you know. They got upset about copying it, you know, don't copy

                        allow young school kids to find themselves the big, the people who control things because
                        of their money, they controlled computers, were no longer going to be in power in the computer

                        to be, in a sense, in more power. That was the revolution in the way we saw it. The us - them,
                        was only in the sense of, we were kind of turning the tides, not so much on the large computer
                        manufacturers but the large companies who owned computers, the companies that we worked for and
                        that owned computers but had restricted us from them, kept us from having good access to them.
                        And to a lesser extent, us versus, us versus them we kind of saw ourselves doing a
                        better a job but the large companies that made computers like Hewlett-Packard were predicting
                        that these small computers, they're nothing. It's a little hobbyist fad. They're going to be
                        dinky kids sold in surplus stores. There's no, there's really nothing to this. It's like they

                        to be able to play games. And it's here now and it's affordable and everybody can have one. And,
                        we thought it was the greatest thing ever. And we could see it. We could see what they could
                        do and these other companies, didn't, didn't even talk. You know, they're marketing people and
                        they're business people. They didn't talk the same language we did. They talked proper business

                        very large and involved. But they didn't, they were not the users. You could tell, they didn't
                        realize what this thing was, you know. This was a computer in the home. They just talked about
                        it like the market size, such and such a share and this and that. Oh, man, so it was kind of we
                        were, we always made fun of that that they, you know, we'd always open up one of the magazines
                        and someone would read a story about such and such a company doesn't think it's a very big
                        marketplace and we'd all laugh. </seg>

                        motivating. It made you feel that what you were doing had value. It had value at least to these
                        groups. You could do something and show it off and that gave you another sense that what you
                        were doing had value. You had a lot of freedom in those days. It wasn't like, there were a
                        couple of brands, you can make a choice. There's standard word processor to buy. Nothing was
                        kind of, there was no structure, it was unstructured. We used to, every meeting, it was very,
                        very important that Lee Felsenstein, our leader announced, this is the Homebrew Computer Club
                        which does not officially exist. And everyone applauded. For some reason, it was a group of
                        people that were glad that they didn't exist formally. Very much against structure and
                        that, that also was motivational. It let you be very autonomous, let you do kind of what
                        you wanted to do. There were a lot of choices and nobody to push you and telling you, you were
                        making a wrong choice. What processor you chose, whether you were going to build your own
                        computer or buy one of the kits, what magazines, you know, you bought, what, what your interests
                        were, it was all different. It was scrambled.</seg>

                        it that turned out to be minor competitors but pretty much not so. For example, Processor
                        Technology made some computers and I'm trying to think, there were a couple of other
                        companies that made boards that would plug into that computer among others. If there was any
                        competitiveness in 1976, several of the companies making the first small computers banded
                        together, kind of against the first computer company, MITS. They banded together and said, MITS,
                        MITS had come out with this great computer, the Altair 8800. They had the Altair bus. And one of
                        the first things these other companies decided to do was to not give this bus a name that's
                        named after a company's product but to neutralize it and call it the S-100 bus. And oddly enough
                        that's very, that's sort of a political thing and not the thing that technical people do very
                        often. Technical people gen., generally, you know, are, are upset when, you know kind of,
                        somebody's name gets removed from something. What do we have? We used to have
                        Washington's birthday and now it's President's Day. You used to have Easter vacation and now
                        it's spring break. It's like these names kind of get pulled away for some political reason
                        to try to, try to hide them. And we're the sort of people that are against that. So I, I never
                        understood. </seg>

                        top designers, the sort of people that do excellent, excellent work. They were not, maybe the,
                        the brightest, you know, top students. I was one, I was rare in that sense. I had taught myself
                        to be a very good designer. I worked for Hewlett-Packard, a top company designing calculators.
                        Most of the people at the club were like the other people designing computers, that were coming
                        out in those days, all the computers that come out were kits. Okay, that speaks of this
                        hobbyist, surplus parts, capacitors and resistors and a couple big, big inductors, you know.
                        This, this kind of world that people live in, some very strange stores, not even the normal
                        electronic stores and their designs showed it. You'd look at their design it would be way too
                        many parts, way too many components, too many chips for what they did. They would use the, the,
                        lousier, lower, state of RAM chip, of memory chip, just simply because it was the one hobbyists
                        were used to. It was available on the surplus market. It was, you know, in stores. And I
                        was just by looking at their designs, I was not impressed technically with the other people
                        designing computers. Most of the people in the club that I got to know I had a similar opinion
                        of that they were not at the top technically. They just, motivations we were alike. And so I was
                        maybe one of the rare ones where I always designed to try to do the most excellent job. I was, I
                        sort of knew that in certain kinds of designs I was better than anyone else that I had ever
                        encountered. And I would come to the club and pull out a board that had maybe a third as many
                        chips as another computer, maybe a fifth as many that did the same thing. And I'd show this one,
                        simple, little board doing what five boards over there did and even more and just amazing
                        people. You mean you can sit down and just type on this, this one little board, you can type on
                        a keyboard and see it on a TV set? And over there, you have to have this huge apparatus that
                        costs a fortune with a ton of boards and you have to have a special monitor, not a TV set
                        and you don't even have a keyboard to type yet. You have to toggle some switches and push
                        buttons. And so I was a little bit, my, my stuff was probably kind of impressive but I
                        wasn't expressive enough to, to even explain to most of the people what this one had the others
                        didn't have, why it was a better direction. I just chose that I liked computers for a couple
                        things; writing some programs to help me at Hewlett-Packard in my job and playing games. And I
                        designed the computer very specifically to have some good features for that. But it wasn't like
                        the other computers. They were just to be like normal computers that you'd buy normal
                        computers that people were used to using at their own places of employment, the same style of
                        computer that had been shipped by manufacturers for ten years, the sorts of things those
                        computers did were not play games, they didn't have color, they didn't have graphics, they
                        didn't have paddles, they didn't come with a keyboard built in, they didn't attach to your home
                        TV, they didn't have all these real nice, simple ideas. But I was lucky. I was only building the
                        computer for myself. That was one of the neat things. And the club was a place you could show it
                        off. There were, if you designed a product just for yourself, it might be a great product but
                        it's hard to get, show it to a marketplace, hard to show it anyone necessarily. But his club, it
                        was just a place where, it doesn't matter what you have. You have anything at all that's
                        interesting, there are some people here, some technical people that would love to look at it and
                        give you some good comments and say neat. And I had a group that gathered around me at every
                        meeting as I designed the computers. </seg>

                        maybe, that got this kind of interest was maybe the 8008. But around the time our Homebrew
                        Computer Club started, the 8080 had come out. It was the hot microprocessor. It was the one that
                        was in almost all these kits. But to me, and to the other technical people, the hot processor
                        means the one that performs the best, that does the most the fastest, that's the easiest to use,
                        that has more instructions than the other. That's the hot processor. And the 6502 was the most
                        recent one that had been introduced, that's the one I chose. I chose it only because, instead of
                        paying $400 to some distributor that wants me to act like I'm a company, I went over to, went to
                        a show in San Francisco called WestCon and with a bunch of my friends, paid $20 over the counter
                        and go this chip. You know, it's like a $400 product is being sold for $20 to people. Like, you
                        can go down to a store and buy it. We had never heard of this sort of thing for a
                        microprocessor. And a microprocessor is a computer. Well, I bought it because it was cheap but
                        it was the newest one. And I opened up the instruction book and it had so many features in it,
                        hands down, hands down, I claim it was the hot one in terms of performance. </seg>

                        I got a group that gathered around me and it was maybe 20 strong that became 6502 enthusiasts
                        either because that's the chip they had bought or because they planned to build the computer
                        that I was showing off. They planned to buy that computer somehow. When we started the
                        company, I think it was real easy for a company building a product on the old standard chip, to
                        look at anybody using a new chip and one of the things that you'd say is, they're not even using
                        the hot processor that there's a lot of software out that uses it. For example, you could buy,
                        if you bought one of the many computers, using that other chip, the Intel chip, you could buy
                        basic language, you could buy a lot of games, you could,. there were a lot of things that were
                        coming out from various companies that you could add on to your computer. If you bought a new
                        computer like the Apple with the 6502, you got a couple programs from Apple that came from it.
                        You got some help from Apple. But it was kind of, start writing your own. And it wasn't for,
                        till about a year after the Apple II was out that a lot of games, good games using color
                        graphics on a TV screen set, sort of set the tone for where games were going to go in our life,
                        video games, small, little, color pictures moving on a screen combined with sounds. It had never
                        been, never happened before. Nobody could have predicted it. We did not predict it. We didn't
                        build those features in. I didn't build those features in thinking people were going to write
                        these kind of games that now every Nintendo game you buy is along that style of colored graph.,
                        colored characters moving around on a screen and colored pictures and all. No, I just sort of
                        threw it in because, well, it's color, it's graphics. I don't know where it goes. I don't know
                        what people use it for. I even argued briefly that maybe we ought to leave it out and save three
                        chips. And Steve fought, you know, no, let's put it in, we got it. It wasn't till the games
                        showed up that we knew what people were going to do with it. Well, it was around that time,
                        after that first year, and all of a sudden the Apple had all these great games and the other
                        machines didn't cause we had a better processor, a hotter one, in technical terms. It was
                        easier, well, we really had a hotter computer. Our computer, for a very low price, could do a
                        lot of neat things and that invited the software to come, the programs that did all these things
                        and once we had the programs behind us there was no comparison. </seg>

                        experiences were that large companies like General Electric came around to our high school and
                        showed how we could have terminals but our school did some calculations. I think just the phone
                        bill alone to connect to it was bothersome. It was too expensive. I even wrote when I
                        was in high school I wrote a, after a GE demonstration of their machine. I was the only one who
                        could program. I sat down and wrote a couple little programs that did something. I wrote a
                        letter to the head of our math department, why we should have computers, why they would help
                        people learn important thing. But school wasn't into that in 1968. I also was, there was a
                        local company called - Call Computer and for a lower price you could call, they had a cheaper
                        computer, for a fairly low price, if you had a terminal, you could phone them up and connect for
                        just a few bucks an hour you could type away and run some programs and it was kind of, kind of
                        popular among the hobbyists. It was even a place where we had a low price account that was given
                        to the club so that every Tuesday night, I think, club members could come on at a reduced price
                        and chat with each other through a program called Chat. They could send messages to one
                        another. I, I used to send the, I wrote a program of my own that would sit there and wait until
                        this file called Chatex freed up. As soon as it freed up I'd dump 14 pages worth of Polack jokes
                        into it. And everybody came back to the club meeting complaining that every, when they did this
                        Chat program it just dumped 14 pages of Polish jokes on them. And Randy Wiggington was a
                        friend of mine that was supposed to maintain it for the club and they always chastised him for,
                        why is this happening? All these things that were going wrong with it and nobody knew it was me.
                        Time sharing, time sharing it was interesting cause that's what got me a
                        little bit into computers. I saw a friend of mine, John Draper, sitting at a terminal talking to
                        computers out in Boston playing chess. But it just wasn't close and quick. It wasn't' fast. Kind
                        of, you'd always type something and wait and wait and wait. Ch., ch., ch., and here would come a
                        slow, little answer, it would type it out on a typewriter and then you'd type in the next
                        answer, it was text only. Had a lot of the time sharing systems they weren't real, real
                        quick, real personal, colorful, they weren't so much fun. They could do and they were expensive.
                        They were expensive. You could pay as much on a time sharing system, I mean, let's say, let's
                        say you had a job at work to do and you, went and wrote a bunch of programs, you could easily
                        spend a few hundred dollars, easily. If you wanted to, I could not afford to use when
                        the 6502 microprocessor came out and I bought it. I wanted to write the basic language. That's
                        a, that's a many man month job, maybe up to a man year's worth of work to write this kind of a
                        program. And I'm supposed to rent time on a time sharing system to write the code called
                        computer language, machine language, to write the code and have the computer assemble it and
                        give me back the codes that will run on my processor. You're supposed to rent it on a time
                        sharing machine. It would have cost me thousands of dollars to have done that. So, I couldn't
                        use it, what's called an assembler. I couldn't use the assembler on a time sharing system, I
                        couldn't afford to. I had to figure out a way to do it myself and the way I did it was I looked
                        at conversion cards and I figured out all the codes myself. I had the entire basic is
                        handwritten, was, it's rare to find a program that wasn't somehow entered into a computer to
                        calculate. I did it all myself on paper and wrote down the codes. And I've still got my
                        handwritten copy but that was the biggest problem of time sharing. None of us had money. Company
                        coming up with a product, some test equipment for engineers had enough money to put into that
                        product cause you had to, to, to write some programs on a computer to help develop it. We
                        didn't, once we had our own computer we had computing free forever, just the cost of electricity.

                        science clubs, that sort of thing. I
                        didn't think, you know, once, once you get to a certain age, you're still, if you're
                        technically, you're always a bit young. You're playing pranks, you're doing a lot of jokes. But
                        you kind of think the grown-up world is just more of a world of reading the financial reports or
                        newspapers and going to work every day and you're out of the young life. Clubs kind of go with
                        the younger life. And it was a club, like ham radio clubs are so it, it was a place to
                        belong and find other people that had similar interests, that would sit down and talk with you.
                        I had people that, you know, I was very shy but I ran into a few people and I invited them over
                        to my apartment, with, you know, filled with wires and junk on the floor, you know, the typical
                        techie place, a technical nerd I was but I could talk to them about something, which was what I
                        was doing, what computers should be, how my computer was different. And these were about
                        the only sort of people I could have socialized with in my life. So I was lucky to have a good,

                        important event of my life. I lived for it. Every spare minute of every day, up late till 2, 3,
                        4 in the morning. I had asthma for a while and couldn't sleep and I had to force myself to stay

                        certain number of programs perfect, as perfect as could be by Wednesday night for the Homebrew
                        Computer Club meeting because I could pass them around to a few people. We had a part of the
                        club meeting, we could just pass them out to anyone who wanted them. And everybody would take
                        something that was given. I tried to get the next stage of my computer always done by the
                        meeting. And I don't think I ever missed once, one of my goals for what I'd have done by the
                        next meeting. But, boy, it just drove my life, gave it a reason to have a schedule. But that's
                        because it was the most important thing happening in the world. It was, it was like a revolution

                        almost sort of a hippie type personality, eating figs all day long. But he also those kind
                        of people very often that want to, wanted to make money. Wherever you can find a place to make
                        some money and have a business of your own. Now I, I started, I came back from all the computer
                        club meetings and I would tell Steve what they were talking about. They might have a disc some
                        day, floppy disc on these things. And his first reaction was, maybe it could do time sharing and
                        replace the time sharing company. And he started coming up with ideas right away, how this thing
                        could be turned into product, how it could be marketed. And he knew that I was a great designer
                        and so he kind of stayed on top of it. Largely through me, he attended some meetings also. Well,
                        I designed the Apple I computer, didn't have a name yet, just to show it off at the club, pass
                        out schematics. I would go over to people's houses and help them build these things. And Steve
                        saw the interest. He saw that there were a lot of people that were interested in getting
                        schematics, building their own, somehow. But he also he came to me and said, well, it
                        takes a long time to wire it together, to solder wires onto all the chips and interconnect them.
                        It takes a long time. People, there are people that don't want to spend that much time. If we
                        make a PC board then all they have to do is plug in the chips, solder them one time quickly and
                        everything is done and they save a ton of work and everything, you know, has a better chance of
                        working, etc.. And so his idea was, we start a company to sell boards. It costs us 20 bucks to
                        make a board. We sell it for $40. And we kind of visioned, visioned selling 50 somehow, we'd get
                        our money back. I didn't think we'd sell 50 at our club cause I'm thinking, how many people are
                        really into the 6502 and going to buy a board for 40 bucks, and I didn't think it was going to
                        be 50 at our club. But that's, that's, I saw a narrow part of the world. Steve always saw a much
                        grander part of the world and he had bigger ideas and he was, he, he was the one who would be
                        driving to move on some idea that might have potential either to be successful in a business
                        sense or to be successful in somehow bringing this technology to people. I don't think he was
                        motivated the same way most of us were by the sense of now we're, we're freeing computers up. I
                        think his, his motivation was always more, in a business sense, it was good if it was business,
                        good if it made a profit. He, he was just in., interested. He was young. He had a lot of time
                        and a lot of energy. You need someone like that to make a product successful, to get on the
                        phone, to talk people into it, to show them what it has. Your own excitement will sometimes
                        carry over to a person in a store whose decided to buy a couple computers because he just opened
                        a new computer store. It will carry over. He'll see, if you're so excited about it, it must be
                        good, proud of product, you know, and that really helped, helped everything. You need a person
                        who wants to hustle and wants, whose motivation is to have a successful company. It took...

                        made them in the garage. I was moonlighting. I had a full time job. I had money to live on. I
                        had an income. Steve lived with his parents. He didn't need an income. We didn't make money with
                        the Apple I's. We only built maybe 150 of them. The Apple II was our first big computer and
                        we had to form a real company. That's where the decision came to me by the, the fellow who was
                        going to join us as a third partner and put up all the money and guide the business in the sense
                        of, he knew what kinds of people to hire, how to organize the business, what should be paid
                        attention to, how to speak to money people to raise more money. Mike Markkula had a business
                        experience but he told me that I had to quit Hewlett-Packard. It has to be a full-time Apple --
                        I, I said, I see Hewlett-Packard, in my mind, I was a young, shy, scared engineer and I've got a
                        good lifetime job at Hewlett-Packard, security. And you know, I can be an engineer forever
                        there. And he said, no, you got to, you got to leave. I said, well, but I've designed two
                        computers. I've written the basic language. I've written all these demo programs. I've designed
                        cassette interfaces and this and that and I, I've done all this in one year just moonlighting.
                        Why don't I keep doing that? No, Steve, you got to quit. And I made the decision at first, not
                        to quit and it wasn't till a friend of mine who had dome some computers with me, the one
                        person ever in my high school that understood computers also, he worked at Hewlett-Packard and
                        he told me, Steve you could be an engineer, start a company, you can go into management and get
                        rich. I couldn't be a manager ever in my life. You know I saw corporate politics and things like
                        that, that was not my life. All I was, was a designer. I wanted to design neat computers, write
                        neat programs. But he said, Steve you could be an engineer and start this company and just be an
                        engineer your whole life and get rich. And then I realized, he was the first person, that I
                        realized was another person out there that accepts it. You can start a company even though you
                        don't want to be a businessman. You don't want to run a company. You can have other people do
                        that. You can simply start a company and if I like and I can still design, I can still do what I
                        love doing, designing good products, writing good programs. The thing is, the company is just a
                        way to help turn it into money and get good stuff into other people's hands. So, I changed my
                        mind.  I felt that the response to the Apple I in reduction at the Homebrew Club was
                        good. People, I held the board up. I fielded some questions that people asked. I could say, it's
                        got this much memory. It's got these kind of chips and it's all on one board and it's easy, it's
                        simple, it's already, it's already assembled. You can buy it for a good price. I had good things
                        technically, I knew that the product competitively was excellent and that's all I needed to give
                        me enough motivation to be able to speak in front of people, you know. It was felt like showing
                        off. I felt the response was good. We only sold maybe 150 cause Steve, you know, had to get on
                        the phone and call a couple computer stores. There weren't very many computer stores in the
                        country. One time, our second sale, he made our first sale to the Byte Club of Palo Alto. And
                        instead of buying $40 PC boards, they wanted to buy $500 completely assembled computer boards.
                        So, all of a sudden, we were in business for real. We had, Steve made, hustled, made all the
                        calls and got us 30 days credit. It only took us ten days to build the computers and get paid
                        for them. So he, so he did that and I went down our second sale. I went to a store in Southern
                        California, cause I was on vacation, showed them the Apple I, what it was, isn't that,
                        demonstrated it. Got some orders out of that. But it was pretty much, you know, one person at a
                        time, you know, getting small accounts. So we didn't sell very many in the period of a year. And
                        by then, we had the Apple II. We even saw the Apple II coming and part of the Apple II
                        introduction was, we said, you can turn in your Apple I for a real good refund or a discount on
                        the Apple II. </seg>

                        those PC boards that cost 40 bucks each. Well, the trouble is, you have to pay somebody to lay
                        out, put tape on a board for a couple of man weeks of work. You have to pay somebody several
                        hundred dollars just to tape up the boards. Then you have to go down to a company that's going
                        to make the boards for you and tell them, make me 50 or make me a 100 and you have to pay them
                        so much money per board. So we needed money. And I had, I had a Hewlett-Packard 65
                        calculator, which I sold for $500. The thing is, working at Hewlett-Packard I knew that next
                        month we were coming out with the HP-67 and my employee price was going to be $370. So, in other
                        words, I didn't take a risk. I knew I was going to be able to get a better calculator for less
                        in one month anyway. Steve sold his van. I think he needed some other living money anyway.
                        It was just, you know, part of ongoing. We really didn't really put that much money in, didn't
                        take a big financial risk. But that helped us, that gave us the money to pay a guy in Scott's 
                        Valley that laid out the PC board for us. We had no money in the bank account. </seg>

                        a big event to me. I had never been out of California except for a year of school in Colorado.
                        And all of a sudden because of Apple and this Apple I thing that really wasn't earning us money,
                        just a little. It managed to pay for our plane tickets out to Atlantic City, far on the East
                        Coast. I mean I'd never been to, you know, very many States in my life. And here I was going to
                        a new one. So it was exciting to just to be traveling, to be a part of something happening. This
                        was the revolution. We got there and found that there were, you know, 30 or 40 different
                        companies that were just like Steve and I, a couple of people in blue jeans, a couple of kids
                        that had designed something, shown it off, looking for sales, you know, trying to start this
                        industry, no business backgrounds at all. Saw a lot of the products going on then. We felt
                        very, very good about the Apple I because it stood up with features for price. It stood up very
                        well. It was an easy computer to show off. You didn't feel embarrassed that you were showing
                        something, somebody else had the equivalent of. So, you know. </seg>

                        Not too much. We got another friend to come in from New York and help demonstrate it. Steve
                        and the other friend really demonstrated it because I sat in the hotel room the whole time. I
                        was typing away on a, on an Apple II computer. And I was, I was working out in maybe the some of the routines that were going to go into the Apple II, maybe some of my routines for
                        drawing lines or adding a couple commands to the basic language. I think while we were there at
                        the show, oh, even on the Apple I, I added commands to the basic language to handle strings, a
                        word like Steven or a word like banana has a spelling. And you have to be able to handle those
                        kind of words in a computer language. We didn't have it quite yet in the basic I'd written. So I
                        added it, got it all working and we, we put it out and demonstrated it, right there at the show.

                        going out there, there were people, some other loca people from a few of the other companies,
                        like Lee himself and a couple of the people from Proc, Chrememco, was another company that
                        came out of our club. We were all on the same plane and I think that they kind of always
                        wondered, you know ha, the two Steve's, what do they think they're doing? What have they
                        got? You know, inside I, I never, I could have never seen somebody thinking that. They probably
                        did think that sort of thing but I knew that our computer was ahead of theirs in what it could
                        do for how much. Steve was the businessman type that could sell it, had the hustle, you know, he
                        could hustle it and make people hear and understand and had the kind of excitement you also
                        need. You can have a better product, you can have a better product and still not succeed in
                        sales. I sort of didn't know that then but I sure know it now.

                        could never have thought that someone would have that sense. The second thing is, the way my
                        life is organized, it wouldn't have mattered to me. I thought we were going up. This was
                        the big time in our life. It's interesting to hear that others might have been talking about us
                        like heading for a big fall. I, a lot of people probably could see, even looking back, I
                        can see, it was, you know, visible, and a lot of people have always told me that, that, sort of
                        like Steve was using me a bit. I designed the whole computer and, and and Steve was just,
                        you know, kind of hustling nothing, selling sugar water or something. But I knew the computer
                        was the best. It was the one I would have wanted to buy. And, you know, and I was just a
                        technical person. I could only judge it objectively, you know. And, and you could look at the
                        results. I mean even the processor technology Sol computer, strangely enough, Lee might have
                        felt that then. But the Apple I was the first computer that came out that said, a computer for,
                        this low cost computer for people should be metaphor of a typewriter, kind of. It's got a
                        TV screen, your home TV and you type on a keyboard. That's how it comes. Up until then the
                        computers were square boxes with a bunch of toggle switches and LED lights and that was the idea
                        of a computer because somehow you can attach it to an expensive teletype that clunks away. And I
                        said, no, just the keyboard and a color TV and that's what it should be. Well, the, sss., so it
                        looked like a terminal. It looked like a video terminal. That was going to be, that was the
                        standard for a computer. It's interesting because after the Apple I the next computer, I think,
                        was designed by Lee. It was the Processor Technology Sol Computer and it followed the same
                        packaging sell, the same metaphor. It had a keyboard and a video display. And then the third one
                        was the Apple II. So we were having an impact, even if they thought
                        we were going to go down for whatever reasons, maybe because we didn't know the business world,
                        right, maybe we didn't know what kind of computer you had to build to sell it. But sometimes that helped us.</seg>

                        a plastic case, you could just take it out of a box, plug it in a wall and open a manual, you
                        have to attach it to your TV set, takes, you know, a few minutes, still does to this day. And
                        you can start typing away and doing something. All the other computers, you had to solder
                        together, bolt them and bolt parts in place, run wires in here. So it was, the idea was, every
                        computer should be completely built because it doesn't cost that much to build it. And there are
                        a lot of people out there that don't want to build computers. The hobbyists and the technical
                        people can buy the kits and build their own. There are a lot of people that would rather not.
                        When I was in ham radio, I was a ham radio operator in 6th grade, almost every ham radio set was
                        a kit. You'd buy a low cost but you'd build it yourself. And even nowadays, that's really not
                        the case for ham radio. Pretty much you buy them completely built and just use different pieces
                        of equipment. </seg>

                        That was where we introduced the Apple II computer. As soon as we got the, the sheet that said,
                        you know, here's the West Coast Computer Fair coming. Choose your space for a booth. I said to
                        Steve, we should apply right now. We should just send the money in, make a phone call and get
                        this prime space booth. It was like the first one you see when you walk in and we had an
                        Advent projector, television projectors on the big screens were almost unheard of in that day.
                        They were new. And we had a local company that had one that would loan it to us for the show.
                        And we were going to show the Apple II running color, which was unheard of. You see the
                        Apple II had about ten things none of these other small computers had. So it was going to be the
                        star of the show. This was the thing we were sure was going to sell thousands of computers a
                        month. It was so far ahead of anything else. It was just unreal. Just, you know, the world
                        would have to be introduced to what it was. It's biggest advantage turned out to be, probably
                        from Steve's thinking that it was pre-built. It was for a less sophisticated type of
                        person to use.  The we went to the show and there were all these computer companies
                        that had the other products. There was one that looked good technically, if you read it's ad in
                        the magazines. And, I forget what it was called. It had a little blurb called - The Cat's Mu. Mu
                        is the Greek character for micro, microprocessor. But they showed up and they had a bunch, bunch
                        of junk with tons of boards and tons of chips and it was not manufacturable. So we knew that we
                        had no competition to worry about for features competitively. I'd sit there and we'd just
                        explain to people how much it had inside, what this computer could do. We'd run a few
                        demonstrations. Boy, it had all the crowds, all the interest. And from that show we started
                        selling the computer right then. It just. </seg>

                        marketing people. We had Regis McKenna, PR firm handling PR. That's our appearance, I mean, I
                        seem to recall we wore suits or at least dressed nicely for the show. We had, you know, a nicely
                        done booth with drapings and things like that. Everything looked like it was professional even
                        though we had very few employees, you know, maybe three real ones and three close to signing on.

                        looked pretty much like the sort of thing ham radio operators would go for, you know, just kind

                        lot of that discipline to us and even when it came to operations matters, our soon to be
                        president, Mike Scott, who had a lot of experience in that field he brought a lot of, the
                        discipline you need to manufacture the product properly and keep things running that Steve and I
                        might have just, you know, run from problems, not solved them right away, whatever, taken other,
                        you know, less appropriate solutions out. Mike Markkula started, started short., started shortly
                        after the Fair and he had a number of retailers approaching him to sell our computer, where
                        actually had lawyers draw properly a, a sales agreement. You know, it's kind of like the
                        industry had never heard of this sort of thing. Companies were just saying, you know, send us a
                        check and you get, you know, we'll send you the computers, you send us a check and, there were
                        kind of no agreements. I will do this, I will do that, you'll do the other. So we were kind of
                        the most legitimate of the, the young companies or at least one of the most legitimate, when,
                        you know. </seg>

                        with the Apple II and we had no money. And before we ran into Mike Markkula and he decided to join
                        us and loan us a quarter of a million dollars, a lot more of today's dollars before that
                        happened, which was a very unusual way to finance a company, we didn't have a business plan or
                        anything, we went out looking for venture capital. We looked at selling our computer to Atari
                        for a few hundred thousand dollars, you know. Steve thought we could get this kind of money and
                        I was shocked. I couldn't believe it. We tried to sell it to Commodore and Chuck Pedal came
                        by our garage one day, pulled out the Apple II, I ran it through its paces. We gave him a demo.
                        Talked about it. He was interested in it but he went back to Commodore and said, no, we can do a
                        much cheaper version of a computer. We'll build in a cheap display and we'll use different types
                        of memories and it doesn't have to have slots to be expandable. It doesn't need color. It
                        doesn't need paddles. These are all gimmicks. And he, he had a different approach in computers
                        and it took them a while, Commodore came, came out after the Apple. Radio Shack was third. For
                        the next couple years, those were the three names in personal computers, meaning, not a kit
                        computer that you have to build yourself but a computer you can take out of a box and start
                        using pretty quickly. The competition didn't really bother us because the first computers,
                        the Radio Shack and the Commodore were so much less than the Apple in terms of features that we
                        could price ours high, have a very huge profit margin. Everyone wanted an Apple, the only
                        holdback was, it cost more because we priced it so high. Probably cost us less to build
                        than either of the others, I'm sure of that. We were afraid of some oncoming competition.
                        Companies like Hewlett-Packard and I and TI that knew a little bit more about making products
                        might come in. That was, Steve was particularly anxious and scared that, you know, if you don't
                        run with a new product every six months you're out of it, you know, because that's the message
                        you get from marketers of consumer electronic products you whole life is that every six months
                        there's something new that makes everything else before it, obsolete. We didn't really,
                        have much competition. In other words, people deciding, retailers deciding they would
                        rather handle the Commodore line or the Radio Shack line. It was easy to get shelf space in
                        virtually every computer store in the country and they were all new. They were just opening up
                        for us.  Now, the competition was resolved. The competition between the Apple and the
                        Commodore and Radio Shack computers was resolved in, a little over a year's time, because what
                        happened was the first programs needed very little memory and they ran and played games on
                        the computers and people liked them, even if they were on a little black and white text computer
                        or if they were on the nice, colorful Apple. But the programs got more and more sophisticated
                        and one major thing happened by 1978, the pro., all of a sudden good programs came out like the
                        first spreadsheet program that could do a whole bunch of calculations up and down several
                        columns on your TV screen at once. And that was called VisiCalc. But a program like that
                        needs about 16K of memory. The Apple had the ability for 48K of memory. But the Radio Shack and
                        the Commodore were both limited in their upper models to 8K only. 8K only wasn't enough for a
                        good program. So, all of a sudden, we were the only ones that could have this good spreadsheet
                        program, VisiCalc. And also we invented a floppy disc, around that time, but you need a bunch of
                        memory in your computer to run a floppy disc. The amount of memory that Radio Shack and the
                        Commodore had, wasn't enough. They could not easily add a floppy disc. They had to go back to
                        the drawing boards and that cost them a year and a half, that was Apple I. </seg>

                        things you do is, well, I'm a hardware designer, among other things. Let's go out and design
                        some peripherals, some things you can add on to it. For example, a board that will connect it to
                        a printer so people can print out their results. That was one of the first projects, a board
                        that will connect it to a modem so it can use phone lines to access larger computers and the
                        like. There are a few other ideas you can come up with for boards that do different things that
                        you plug in. Mike Markkula had actually had a personal, a couple of personal projects he'd been
                        involved with. One was color math for printing color math problems on the screen and that was
                        because he had a 9 year-old daughter and kind of wanted something that would, you know, fit her
                        life. But also he had a checkbook program, he had initiated. And he had Randy Wiggington program
                        it and I helped out a little. And this program let you keep your checkbook. But it had a couple,
                        couple of problems. One of them was, our computer only handled integers. It didn't handle
                        numbers like 37.04. So we had to come up with schemes to handle normal dollar and cents amounts.
                        So he said, we need floating point BASIC. It's a language, a computer language that can handle
                        numbers with decimal points. The other one he said was, well, it took a long time to run
                        checkbook. You had to load a cassette tape into a cassette tape player, loaded it, run it into
                        your Apple II and wait, you'd have to wait a minute while, load it in and it would go - beep,
                        it's done. Then, you'd have to load in another cassette that had all your check information. And
                        wait a minute while it read in, - beep, it's done. And now you can run the program. And when
                        you're all done with the program, you've got to write both of those tapes back out. A long, time
                        consuming, the biggest part of this simple task of doing, updating a couple checks in your
                        checkbook was waiting for the cassette tape recorder. So Mike Markkula said, we need a floppy disc
                        because floppy discs are fast enough. And I had played around with an idea for a real clever
                        floppy disc controller. I didn't know what they were even. But I just knew, it's like magnetic
                        tape. You have to write some signals onto a tape, normal type signals that go up and down like
                        voice. And somehow you have to be able, when it comes back through, you have to be able to read
                        it and figure out what was there. I, that's all I knew about floppy discs. But Steve got a
                        couple floppy discs from Shugart and I sat there and with this clever idea for building one with
                        very few parts and I started working away and partly in the back of my head was, what a
                        neat excuse to go to Las Vegas, a show in Las Vegas in January 19, 1970, oh, gosh, '77 or '78, 1978.
                        Well I thought, what a great chance to go to Las Vegas and see the bright lights and the city
                        that's in movies, if I can show something off. Well, but Mike I can get a floppy disc ready to
                        demo then. And he said, okay. And boy, it was like, only a couple weeks left. And I worked every
                        day over Christmas vacation including Christmas, New Years' Day. Randy Wiggington came in,
                        helped write some software for me. And we got enough going, I got the hardware finished, this
                        clever little circuit with only five chips did what normally 50 take. And Randy wrote some
                        programs that, wrote the data onto the disc in the right order and we pulled out our scopes and
                        we got it working. We went to the show in Las Vegas the floppy disc meant a lot because you
                        could store several programs on one floppy disc at a reasonable cost. And you could say, - run
                        Checkbook, run Color map, run Star Wars, run whatever, you know, it was all there, kind of
                        accessible, a lot of storage, fast. And that really boy that really, that plus the
                        calculation program, VisiCalc, which was good for small business to keep track of some of their
                        account information. Those two alone made the Apple the the sure winner in 1978. By the end
                        of the year we were backlogged hugely. </seg>

                        five people, I don't think he was out of high school yet. And, it was January '78, we were in
                        Las Vegas. And I had been to a couple casinos like with my mother- in-law in Reno and I showed
                        Randy, kind of taught him how to gamble a little, play some craps and, he, he, we'd gamble, stop
                        in the casinos but we'd walk down to the convention center and I still didn't have the floppy
                        disc completely working to where you could - run Checkbook and it would run. But I was real
                        close. And we went down there, all night long, programmed away, programmed, tried this, fixed
                        that, tried it over and over. We finally got it finished at 6 in the morning. And then Randy
                        said, - let's make a copy of the disc so we'll have a copy. I said, good idea, you're thinking.
                        We were so tired that what we did was, we copied a bad disc onto the good one. But, I, I finally
                        restored it by about 8 in the morning and we actually showed it off. And, yeah, it worked fine
                        and boy it, it started gaining some interest from that day. And we knew we had a real product.
                        And then we sort of stopped changing the floppy disc and we started thinking out a strategy for
                        what type of floppy disc. We I had basically, Shugart, built into the floppy disc, had
                        about 30 chips. And I just thought, well more efficient. I just bypassed about 20 of them. You
                        know, I think we wound up only using four of their chips. And so Steve Jobs went to Shugart
                        and talked them into making us a cheaper version that didn't have as much on it cause they had a
                        lot of stuff in there that you really didn't need if you, if you implemented the floppy disc the
                        way we did. And the product was turned out to be very easy to, to take from there into
                        production. I was so proud of my design, I sat down and did the P., I laid out the PC board
                        myself, taping little mylar strips. Came in every night. I was in every night till, you know, 2
                        to 4 in the morning, last technicians have left, taped it up and, oh, I just, it had to be so
                        pure and have very holes in the board. And then I figured out a way I could make it one less
                        hole. So I scrapped everything and re-did it for another week. And very, very seldom you
                        find the engineer, normally an engineer doesn't get the chance to lay out his own
                        board but give it to somebody else who paid less money and they lay out the PC board. But, one
                        of the neat things that happens when you cross disciplines and you do the design but you also
                        lay out the PC board is, you can start the, the PC board layout would be a little bit cleaner if
                        I changed the design. See, normally the guys laying out a PC board can't dare change the design.
                        You know it's not in his, his authority, his mandate he's not allowed to do that. So, that
                        was kind of, kind of interesting and it was neat. And a few people, over the years, noticed how
                        very, very tiny and tight that board was. </seg>

                        around, building computers, showing them off, becoming successful. It's the story that's easier
                        to tell and easier to sell. Mike Markkula had a business background. He'd made a million dollars
                        on a stock option at Intel already. So, you know, he was sort of successful already in his
                        own right and he's a stable, you know, business type person. But, it's real clear that every
                        step of the way, he knew how large we could get, he knew what steps we had to take to get there.
                        He spent a lot of time reading business magazines, financial magazines, you know. He even told
                        me in the early days his thing was making money and this was how he planned to do it and we, how
                        large we were going to become. Almost everything he predicted came, came about. You know,
                        with some of my business experience now, I can look back and see where he was coming from. He
                        was right on target. But we didn't know this. Steve had no business background neither did I.

                        chips and started teaching myself but I always made it a rule, like a game, to try to get it to
                        fewer parts is better. And I, I was, I excelled at that. I was very good at all, every design,
                        everything I ever designed, all sorts of hobby projects, projects I designed for other
                        companies, moonlighting, things I designed for Hewlett-Packard, the Apple computers, very proud
                        that my design was much fewer parts than all these other little companies coming out. And I don't know, it just makes you feel that you've done something yourself that's so valuable,
                        it's motivating you. It gives you a lot of energy. It makes you want to show it to people, talk
                        about it, go on and design the next thing. You just don't like run out of energy like, mah, it's
                        just a thing I'm doing, you know, just a job. No, no, no, it's your whole life is, is on
                        display. You know all my circuits, you know, of, even things besides Apples stuff, though, I
                        always felt that way about. And it was like an art. I found out later on, when we started Apple,
                        that there's only about one out of every ten engineers that is really that superb, that just
                        chases perfection to the nth degree. And those are the few that are like artists. And I was, I
                        was just one of that type. I just work and work and work for an extra, you know, five hours in
                        one night to save the tiniest, little bit of code in a program, figure out a way to get past it.
                        It seemed like you were getting closer to perfection, closer to what God intended. If something
                        just sort of worked out with almost no parts, it was somehow the way nature meant the world to
                        turn out. </seg>

                        was growing. They started out like the Homebrew Club, kind of loose, just a few people,
                        technical interest they had computers. They, you know, started buying computers. They, they
                        started growing in size, getting more organized to have separate interest groups and how they
                        would run their meetings and presentations of affairs going on, you know, presentations of new
                        products. And I'd say that was very, very important to Apple because Apple was kind of
                        this new thing that people didn't know what it was yet. Today, it's easy to know what a computer
                        is, to buy tons of software and programs that tell you what it is and how to use it. Back in
                        those days you didn't have that kind of communication tool. You got a new product and you want
                        to talk to people about it, you want to find out how to solve some problems you're having. Go to
                        a meeting. Ask other people. Or, other people will show you. You can also pick up new
                        products at the meetings. Also once the games started coming out in 1978 on tape, in 1979
                        on disc. Boy, that was the place to collect games and copy them even if they were copy
                        protected, find out ways to crack them and pass them around to the clubs. So the user groups,
                        user groups really were like a big promotion, largely for the company. They tended to
                        orient around a computer, an Apple users group. Unlike the Homebrew Computer Club which was just
                        computers themselves as a technology, the club started being, Commodore Clubs or Apple Clubs,
                        you know, for one brand of computer. It just worked out better that way. </seg>

                        billion dollar market in a few years. Just, well maybe only once a decade. And that's the

                        years- That is what he predicted for us. In the back of my head I said, well, the more
                        successful a marketing person you are and Mike Markkula was successful already, the more, the more
                        successful you are the bigger number you throw out, you know. One guy will say, you can be a ten
                        million dollar company because, you know, he's acting like he knows what a ten million dollar
                        company is and he's big. And Mike Markkula was just the best so he was using the biggest number of
                        all. And I really, you know, didn't have any feeling for what that meant or if it was possible.
                        And it was really, quite a bit later, 1979, sometime, maybe close to when we were going public,
                        I was in at Apple and Steve kind of grabbed me. He said, you know, we made more money than our
                        parents, you know, in their whole lifetime. And maybe he and I were each worth a few million
                        dollars by then. And it just sort of, right then, I just sort of realized it. I'd never thought
                        about it till then. It was kind of stunning. And then it just kept going up, things kept

                        manager and section managers, you know, I mean, it was kind of, you know, structured and, I, my

                        had started and it was harder for me to just sort of sit back and do one simple task at a time.

                        company. And we went, but we went public on the strength of the Apple II sales plus
                        the Apple III as an upcoming product that was going to sell to business. I, you know, I, you

                        sell it even before being public. There were private investors and there was just a procedure
                        for doing it. We just went public because the timing was sort of right. You know, just
                        public image of Apple, how much press we'd been getting, we had a new product coming out. It
                        was the best time to go public and we were going to be forced to go public anyway eventually

                        to give me then. But I, I'd rather do it to insiders and many, many of them, over the years, are
                        very fulfilling, that they wrote me and said it enabled them to buy a house, was the usual
                        response. And I always felt good about that. And no one has ever done anything like that. It was
                        very strange, our, our lawyers were a little scared about letting that one even happen, I think.

                        besides the Woz Plan which is, they were identified, I think, five people who had been employees
                        at an earlier date and had not received stock. And their presence, maybe they weren't an
                        important job in the company but if Bill Fernandez hadn't been there wiring stuff up, joking
                        with me, chatting with me, I wouldn't have felt good about what I was doing. He was a part of
                        this little start-up when we were eight people. And there were about five people I
                        identified in that category that just hadn't been compensated and they were such a key part to
                        what had happened. And each of them, I think I gave them a large amount of stock, you know,
                        later on proved important in their lives but they deserved it. You know in my opinion. Mike
                        Markkula might disagree in business, business ethics sense. No, what they do is not important. It
                        can just be purchased. You know, it's not some rare element but I don't know, it's, like if I
                        deserve to be this successful financially then so, so do they. They were a part of it. </seg>

                        before. We kept certain accounts balanced, did certain calculations to see how a business would
                        go or how our checkbook was going or we kept lists of the records we owned, kept mailing lists
                        and those things. Did it by pencil and paper. This was just a more efficient tool for a lot less
                        effort you could get these things done. It helped, it really helped usher in the day of,
                        computer games or tel, television video games in the home, in your home. It, it just
                        set a tone that there, there's a new kind of product that can help some people with things
                        that they can do at home, you know. Or, it's, now it's really a, even a small business tool. It's just less expensive. It allowed us to do a lot more less expensive. For example, when I
                        designed the Apples, we had one computer in my lab at Hewlett-Packard, one computer, it was a
                        mini-computer definitely about as powerful as the Apple II when we first introduced
                        it. And yet it was shared by maybe 80 engineers, what, those who needed it would go and run a
                        program on it. And, they would take turns, all day long, using that computer. Well, now, you
                        walk into an engineering lab and almost everybody has a computer on their desk and they just,
                        and, and the total cost for the entire lab is just as cheap and yet they've got better
                        computers. It's like the price to performance, it's a rare thing that somehow the price for
                        the same machine, the price has dropped like a hundred times just in the last 10, 20 years. It's, very few things drop in price, you know, it's really amazing. It all boils down to how
                        they make chips. </seg>

                        raised, raised the level that a program had to perform at. Maybe because there were so many more
                        people. If you wrote a program now, it could go to a million people easily if it were very good
                        and very general. And boy it was worth putting in all sorts of fine finished touches, making
                        things very understandable, very forgiving. If you make a mistake, it has to be kind of gentle
                        with you and, you know, not rude and it has to give you ways to escape out and give you options

                        company like Univac or IBM and then, all of a sudden, in 1975 and '6 we had this little window

                        computer, the sort of person who was smart enough to use a pencil and paper and figure out some
                        notes, who wanted to make drawings or wanted to play games but a less sophisticated person
                        technically. We approached them, our advertising said, Apple, the name Apple kind of suggests
                        something that fits in your home, that anyone can understand. It's not a technical metamorphosis
                        of, you know, words. We, we appeal to that sort of person. We tried to supply them easy
                        solutions that were understanding and turned out that, that was a big market that had been
                        on the scene in prior years. They existed. They bought a lot of our computers and it made us
                        successful. You know, it might be, some of those steps we could have gone a different direction
                        and been just as successful but that's the one we went in and we were successful. For example,
                        for example, we could have stayed a game company forever, you know, and then maybe we'd only be
                        as successful as Nintendo which is the same as Apple. So, it's, you know, we went in a business
