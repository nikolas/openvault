                        to come and ask you about psychoanalysis. How come that you went into

                        exactly why I chose Medicine, but I can try. You know, I was in Humanistic
                        Gymnasium, eighteen years and we went in that period over most areas
                        eclectic, to be learned about, so predominant Greek and
                        Latin, we went into History and into Natural Sciences, Physics and
                        Mathematics, practically everything one could really consider. So that means
                        that eight years, from 10 to 18, there came the opportunity to choose to
                        decide. And finally I decided Medicine it is, and it stayed for
                    good.</seg></u>

                        medical school. In the gymnasium I was pretty young, seventeen, and it was
                        in the seventh grade in Psychology class, and one of the students got up and
                        told us that her father, a physician in Vienna, had played cards with a
                        friend, Dr. Freud, every Saturday, and Freud told him and the other men in
                        the group that academic psychology figured out some very important parts of
                        what is going on psychologically in people and what motivates them, and what
                        influences their lives, though they are not aware of it. And he called these
                        factors unconscious factors.</seg><seg xml:id="para7" smil:begin="00:03:28.148" smil:end="00:04:22.118">Now, I was very
                        curious, and on my way home I dropped in at... who was then the publisher
                        of Freud and asked for some of his writings, and he gave me Wit and Its
                        Relationship to the Unconscious. I didn’t like it at all. It was confusing;
                        it wasn’t even interesting but I didn’t give up. I went back and asked for
                        another book. At that time, he gave me The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.
                        Now, that was very different—-thought provoking--it was very
                        interesting.</seg></u>

                        medical school, and I remember very well, I was sitting in my Anatomy
                        Lecture between two returned veterans of the First World War, it had just
                        ended. It was 1918. Their names were Edward Bibring and Madame Reich. Both
                        of them became rather known in this country and abroad later on. Now, a
                        little note was passed around and on it was written “Those colleagues who
                        want to know more about certain subjects which are not taught in medical
                        school, or are not taught well, should stay back after the lecture.” Signed,
                        Otto Fenichel, also a man who became very known as a leading psychoanalyst
                        later on.</seg><seg xml:id="para10" smil:begin="00:05:29.694" smil:end="00:06:05.392">I told my two neighbors I was very

                        in the sandbox together and somehow he always stayed there. Then there was
                        another student who wanted to become an endocrinologist and somebody wanted
                        to go into internal medicine. And we set up a seminar—a new seminar—to study

                        conservative things, with textbooks on endocrinology, and then we read
                        [Friese?], who was a close friend of Freud but didn’t know about that, who
                        had the most interesting idea about human physiology—not a correct one, but
                        interesting.</seg><seg xml:id="para15" smil:begin="00:06:55.662" smil:end="00:07:59.725">Then, I think, we read Havelock

                        Freud’s contribution to the theory of sex, and the student who had to review
                        it, was Edward Bibring. Now, he came back to our seminar, and he said, “Most
                        interesting, and most important book.” And I piped up and I really got quite
                        embarrassed about this remark the older I got and then I got old enough not
                        to be embarrassed but amused and touched by this very famous man, and a very

                        called “The Seminar of the Children”. We were the children at that time. So

                        a carefully arranged appointment. So we went to analysts whose books we’d
                        read, including Freud, and asked him simply, “What does that mean?” “What
                        does he advise we should read after it?” And sometimes we simply debated.
                        And you know, it was in the 1920s, early, there was no Institute in

                        we came, we had a number of friends here, former students, colleagues. It
                        was delightful to come to Boston and suddenly to discover how many of our
                        friends were here, and they told us, introduced us into their many ways of
                        life. Now, the interesting thing was that they told us, here in the United
                        States, a doctor gives some service to the hospital. Now, that wasn’t our
                        habit. What we did, we had our own psychoanalytic outpatient clinic which we
                        supported ourselves. It was very interesting and we were told that the Beth
                        Israel Hospital, which is a first-rate hospital, has an outpatient—-that
                        that outpatient wing which is almost exclusively occupied by psychoanalysts
                        in Boston. Now, we were in the outpatient clinic during the war. And so many
                        of our colleagues had to go into service, and somehow they appointed me as
                        the Acting Head of the Outpatient Clinic.</seg><seg xml:id="para89" smil:begin="00:28:38.764" smil:end="00:30:01.488">Now, in
                        the health offices, where interns and residents, felt troubled because they had so
                        little teaching, all the big names, they’re gone. So they now came to me and
                        said that I will teach them how my specialty fits into Medicine. So I was
                        very glad to do so. Now, this was something which I didn’t expect to turn
                        out so beautifully. I taught them but the only hour read was from 1:00 to
                        2:00. Now, they all came and sat down, and half of them fell asleep, because
                        it was after lunch and they were so overworked. So I talked to the other
                        half, and I was sympathetic with them. The next time, the other half was
                        asleep, and some of them were awake, so I acquired the habit of summarizing
                        what I had done the time before. Now, this they never, never forgot. They
                        really became a favorite of theirs, apart from the fact that I think the
                        lectures were really interesting. It’s quite excited over it.</seg><seg xml:id="para90" smil:begin="00:30:01.488" smil:end="00:30:34.783">So when Dr. Blumguard became the new Physician in Chief,

                        psychological disturbances. He had this genius idea that psychiatry really

                        And he said so, constantly, he repeated it, “It’s all for the better.” And
                        finally he said something which stopped me in my flight. He said, “You know,
                        this is the way you psychoanalysts always are. When we try to do something
                        psychological with our sick patients, you look down your noses, and you say
                        it’s all wrong. And we say, ‘Come and help us.’ You say, ‘Sorry, I’m too
                        busy.’” And I knew he was right! And it bothered me. And I also admired this
                        exact, wonderful, psychological gimmick he had, to hit me where I’m
                        vulnerable. You know, years later, it turned out that it wasn’t a gimmick.

                        hand. Because I remember when I had so many friends in the medical school,
                        in the institute, most of them were men. And something came to my attention,
                        very unpleasantly. We had many guests. They were very interesting people and
                        they were interested people and we had discussions on everything. They came
                        with their wives. And all these women were college graduates, and didn’t
                        open their mouth. And I was the only woman, and I was embarrassed because I
                        was the hostess. At least there was something in that family pattern which
                        obviously never came to my attention in my own home.</seg><seg xml:id="para171" smil:begin="00:47:33.586" smil:end="00:47:52.450">In Vienna, I was taken for granted, like another student,

                        had a number of urgent calls and the people who wanted to talk to me were
                        women, young women in the liberation movement, and they came always armed
                        with Freud’s writing on women. Now, they ask me, “How could you work with
                        such a man?” I never thought of it! I mean, he appreciated us, he made no
                        distinction, but he had a certain theory about women that they have a weaker
                        conscience (meaning Super Ego) on the basis of their special anatomical
                        difference, etc. I don’t want to go into all that. I just tell you that he
                        saw women of the turn of the century. Deeply repressed, deeply frustrated,
                        playful, nothing to do. Even my patients were already completely different.
                        And he collaged a theory about what he thought he saw. He always used
                        clinical observations to form a theory. He gave it up when he found that he
                        was wrong. And later on, with the new lectures, etc., he said, “Probably I
                        don’t understand women.” Or the specific. And it might need women analysts
                        to help us out. Now, I don’t think it needs women analysts if that were the
                        case. I wouldn’t understand men patients either.  No, I think here to put two things now together. I
                        don’t know, do you talk about theory about women? Or do you talk now about
                        Madam Mark, and I don’t think it has to be a woman to understand the woman.
                        Because I could communicate with any man what I think, a specific female, or
                        that women can tell it to you, and if you are a person who can listen, you
                        will understand it. Otherwise, I wouldn’t understand you, either. Because
                        you are a man, you have different needs, I’m fully aware of the difference

                        closer to childhood, to emotions because their whole biological function
                        somehow directs them that way and certain things in a woman might be very

                        he talks about the biological foundation and the drives, and the sex drive
                        is one of the most important things, shaping our adjustment, he talks not
                        just about pure sex and intercourse, he talks about all the derivatives of
                        this love. But it’s one nature. This all he compromises in his concept of
                        love and sex. So you can’t say it isn’t sex, it is sublimated and it is a
                        redirected type but there is something underneath this need for another
                        closeness for people. We just call it all part of the primitive, lowdown
