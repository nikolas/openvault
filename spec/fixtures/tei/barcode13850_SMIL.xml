                        And I went to high school for one semester here at Belmont High School,
                        which was largely Mexican-American. And uh, I joined a band, the Vascos
                        Brothers Band, and we played different gigs, um, a lot of jazz, but also
                        some Latino music. And um, then I graduated high school and went to Los
                        Angeles City College. And I was playing some gigs on occasion, you know, not
                        too many. I wasn't really that good. I loved jazz, but I wasn't, you know, I
                        wasn't good enough for my own taste. And um, about that time I decided,
                        since I loved music, I would get involved and study, and I began to study
                        privately with a composer orchestrator to study composition. And that's
                        about the same time that, uh, I met Jerry.</seg>

                        uh, I never, uh, never dreamed of performing. I was writing essentially
                        primarily for blues singers, black blues singers. And I wasn't really
                        interested in anything else. I wasn't interested in pop music, I wasn't
                        interested in country music, I wasn't interested in any, jazz, even in jazz,
                        vocal jazz. I enjoyed it. I liked to listen to it, you know, for my own
                        pleasure. But I was not interested in writing it. I was only interested in
                        the language and the humor and the, the, uh, the pain, whatever, of the
                        blues .</seg>

                        Except, there were a few exceptions like Johnny Mercer sang, a few people
                        sang once in a while, but by and large the tradition of songwriting was the
                        songwriter wrote the songs and he was a behind the scenes kind of character.
                        Now, George L -- George M. Cohan for instance was a great performer. I know
                        about this. But mainly, the songwriter was mainly a behind the scenes
                        guy.</seg>

                        the blues performers wrote their own material, and uh, or at least many of
                        them did. And I guess to some extent, our material was accepted because a
                        lot of these performers who did write were not as good as some of the other
                        ones. And they wrote the same song pretty much over and over.</seg>

                        first sessions, the first meetings were set up by Lester Sill with Modern
                        Records, who, at the, who, uh, which was owned by the Harry Brothers. And
                        the Harry Brothers were completely amusical. I mean they just… they had a
                        business. They could've been in the junk business, it didn't matter, you
                        know. And uh, they had this record company. And they were affable guys, they
                        were easy to get along with, but they really didn't know much about music
                        and didn't care much about it either. And uh, we had some meetings with
                        some, uh, artists -- we met with the Robins, you know. And uh, it was, it
                        was, in the very beginning it was hard to get things straight. You know, it
                        was hard to get things down. And um, it was hard to get things right. And we
                        struggled with that for a long time. And in a funny way, we started to, to
                        produce, really, in self-defense. Because a lot of the songs that we had
                        written -- well, firstly, the first songs we wrote were lousy anyhow, so it
                        didn't matter how well they were produced, they just came out badly. Uh,
                        later on, when we started writing some good songs, they were not produced
                        adequately or properly, or they were misinterpreted. You know, you'd get a
                        swing band arrangement on a blues, right? By a Hollywood arranger instead of
                        the right kind of stuff that you'd get out of someone like Bumps Blackwell
                        or Maxwell Davis, right? So as we went along we learned the different ways,
                        the different styles and so forth and we started producing.</seg>

                        rehearsal. Because we used to rehearse our groups that we worked with, the
                        Robins, the Coasters and so on, for weeks on end before a session. And the
                        traditionally, these people came together in the studio and learned a song
                        on, on the date and, uh, and performed it. And there were some wonderful
                        bands that could, like Johnny Otis's, that could do head arrangements right,
                        uh, you know, from the git, and they'd come off sounding very professional.

                        was so nasty. She was, she was really evil. I loved her. I thought she was
                        great. She had all these razor scars all over her face. Because somebody
                        down there, was, uh, somebody listening said that she was a lady bear, and I
                        didn't know what that was. And I found out maybe five or six or seven years
                        later that, that was a very big female who was a lot of trouble. Um, and she
                        acted that way, but actually she wasn't that way, it was a big front. Like
                        most bears, you know. Um, she just sang her ass off, you know, and impressed
                        us very much. And uh, we looked at each other and decided to take off
                        immediately, and uh, we jumped in Mike's car and headed for his house. And
                        I'd say about, maybe half way to his house I'd already gotten about 50
                        percent of the lyrics to the song. And uh, we landed, and Mike went to the
                        piano, and I started yelling, you ain't nothing but a hound dog, and it all
                        came together in about eight or ten minutes. And we got back in the car,
                        went back to the garage, and we laid the song on Johnny Otis. And uh, he
                        told us to perform it for Big Mama. Which we did. And I started, I think
                        maybe I got through about four bars, and she said, give me that, give me
                        that piece of paper, give me that. And she sort of grabbed the paper out of
                        my hand. It was not written on a brown paper bag, mind you, it was written
                        on a piece of spiral notebook paper. And uh, she started to sing it. And um,
                        actually she started to croon it. And I said, um, it don't go that way. And
                        all of a sudden there was a hush in this garage. The entire band, I think
                        there were 11 or 12 guys on the stand, and they're usually jerking around,
                        you know, high jinks and locker room stuff -- it became quiet as a mouse.
                        And she said, it don't go like that, it don't go like that. She says, I tell
                        you how it go, it go like this -- ahhhhhhhhh. White boy, don't you tell me
                        how to sing the blues. So I looked at Mike, he looked at me. And Johnny Otis
                        came down and said, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, cool it, just wait a
                        minute. He said, Willie Mae, she looked up at him and said, yes sir? She was
                        very polite when she's doing business. [LAUGHS] She wasn't doing business
                        with me. Yes sir. He said, now, we got to stop that stuff, you know? We're
                        here to take care of business, right? She said that's right. Now, give me
                        that song. And hand it to me. Now, sing the song the way it's supposed to be
                        for Big Mama, all right? I looked at Mike, Mike was ready to split. He
                        didn't want to have anything to do with this. He's looking at the back door.
                        I said, Mike, play the piano. He did one of these, who me? [LAUGHS] Finally
                        he went over to the piano, and uh, I sang the song, Mike played the song.
                        And uh, the band went nuts. They loved it. They thought it was funny. These

                        are they doing, you know? And Big Mama finally broke into a smile. I came
                        down, she made up with me, I made up with her, she took the song, and she
                        started singing it. Johnny got on the drums during the rehearsal, and it

                        uh, primarily in Jerry's work but also in mine, in terms of, uh, the radio
                        programs that we listened to as kids. And the characters speaking, because
                        radio, let's face it, was much more interesting than television is because
                        you could imagine all these things. And so using the kind of, uh, radio
                        technique, non-visual but dialogue is the way in which these songs evolved.
                        And this was probably the first one in which, uh, the narration was done in
                        that style. And also, of course, we enjoyed putting in sound effects, which
                        were like things from, uh, what was that program?</seg>

                        this hits it enough. The form musically were the blues. Because Willie
                        Mabon, you know, Little Walter, those blues breaks, that was the form and
                        that was the sound. The content was something that we made up and was very
                        much influenced by early radio, but filtered through a blues idiom in terms
                        of language, in terms of vocabulary, in terms of dialect.</seg>

                        with Lester Sill, who was really our mentor and advisor. And the reason that
                        we started it was so that we would be unencumbered when it came to the
                        creative production of the records. We could take it from beginning to end
                        including the mastering and all the editing and so on and so forth, which is
                        really what we wanted to do, to protect the notion or the integrity of the
                        idea of each song. And the reason that ultimately Atlantic seemed so
                        attractive was two fold. Number one, we loved the Atlantic Records. We
                        admired many of their artists, the Clovers, Ruth Brown and so on and so
                        forth, LaVerne Baker.</seg>

                        Rockies. So we'd have a big smash in LA, selling even a hundred thousand
                        records, singles, and nothing on the other side of the country, zero. So
                        that seemed to be a good idea, which they suggested to us. They said,
                        listen, make the records. We'll pay you a royalty, because we know how to
                        sell them and you don't.</seg>
