    <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Program" descriptionTypeRef="http://metadataregistry.org/concept/show/id/1702.html">On Feb. 23, 1987, one of the most violent events since the creation of the universe was observed.  Ian Shelton, a young Canadian astronomer working on a remote mountaintop in Chile, came upon a supernova--the gargantuan explosion in which a star blows itself apart.  A star blows itself apart in a nearby galaxy, and astronomers scramble to study the rare event.  NOVA covers a fast-breaking science story as it is happening. </pbcoreDescription>

Produced by Blackside, Eyes on the Prize tells the definitive story of the civil rights era from the point of view of the ordinary men and women whose extraordinary actions launched a movement that changed the fabric of American life, and embodied a struggle whose reverberations continue to be felt today.

Through contemporary interviews and historical footage, Eyes on the Prize traces the civil rights movement from the Montgomery bus boycott to the Voting Rights Act; from early acts of individual courage through the flowering of a mass movement and its eventual split into factions. Julian Bond, political leader and civil rights activist, narrates.</pbcoreDescription>

    <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Program" descriptionTypeRef="http://metadataregistry.org/concept/show/id/1702.html">DOCUMENTARY THAT FOCUSES ON THE CONTRIBUTION OF BLACK AVIATORS, BOTH TECHNICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY, TO THE WORLD OF AVIATION.  Rare film footage and dramatic reenactments tell the unknown story of America's pioneering black aviators and the familiar frustrations and struggles created by racial prejudice. This program documents this important phase of history--during the Golden Age of aviators in the 1920's and '30's--including the producer's great-uncle, James Herman Banning. Accompanied by mechanic Thomas C. Allen, Banning was the first black pilot to complete a transcontinental flight, in 1932. The program also celebrates the efforts of Bessie Coleman, the first black pilot to receive a license, which she was forced to earn abroad, in 1922.</pbcoreDescription>
