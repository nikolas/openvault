  <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Clip">"As if Memories Could Deceive Me," 1986, documents a performance or rehearsal of the New England Conservatory Symphony Orchestra, through close-ups, split-screen effects, and collage techniques. Instruments are filmed close-up and appear in boxed-off portions of the screen. As the music rises, archival film images begin to creep in. Many times they are superimposed over the instruments. Film footage includes the interior of a colorful palace, Hitler propaganda and Nuremberg trials, and a men''s clothing store. The original footage produced for this work was shot at the New England Conservatory of Music, the Goethe Institute, and a Louis clothing store.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Robert Schumann's "Manfred" and "Drum and Gong Sounds" by F. Marschall and U. Timmermann are the musical works performed by New England Conservatory Symphony Orchestra.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; "As if Memories Could Deceive Me" was created by Marcel Odenbach for The Contemporary Art Television (CAT) Fund and was co-produced by the Goethe Institute in Boston. It was later broadcast as a segment of Episode 304 of the 1987 season of "New Television."</pbcoreDescription>
  <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Series">The New Television Workshop originated at WGBH, a public broadcasting station in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1974 to support the creation and development of experimental video art. This experimental programming included dance, drama, music, performance and visual arts on video and film. As early as 1968, WGBH was committed to the development of video art through residency programs, with artists such as Nam June Paik, and the "Rockefeller Artists-in-Television" project. Many of these early works (pre-1974) were broadcast both locally and nationally.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As an umbrella for arts related programming, the Workshop included "Artist's Showcase, " "Frames of Reference, " "Dance for Camera, " "Poetry Breaks," and "New Television," as well as acquired arts programming. Individual works were created for "Visions," a series produced by WNET (New York), and "Alive From Off Center," a series produced by KTCA (St. Paul - Minneapolis). The Contemporary Art Television (CAT) Fund was co-founded by the Workshop and Boston's Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA) in the 1980's, to commission works by video artists. In 1993 the Workshop ceased production at WGBH.</pbcoreDescription>
