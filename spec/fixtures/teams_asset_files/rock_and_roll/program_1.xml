          <WGBH_DESCRIPTION DESCRIPTION_TYPE="Summary5" DESCRIPTION="Soul music stretches to create a rock and roll revolution in rhythm and attitude in the '70s. Innovators James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, George Clinton and famed bass players Larry Graham and Bootsy Collins take viewers on a tour of funk as the music becomes bolder and more expressive of the realities of black life. Filmed in New York, San Francisco and Philadelphia, the program also examines how funky dance hits blazed a musical trail to the disco craze of the late '70s." />
