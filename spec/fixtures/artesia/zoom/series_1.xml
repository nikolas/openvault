Seven ZOOMers hosted each program, cast changed over run of series. Premiered locally as &quot;Summer-Do&quot; in 1970, nationally in January 1972. ZOOMers played games, told jokes, riddles (called Fannee Doolees) and stories and did crafts projects...and invited ideas from their audience. The result was an avalanche of ZOOMmail - in the first season, over 200,000 letters. Ubbi Dubbi language was invented by ZOOM." />
