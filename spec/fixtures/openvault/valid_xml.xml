  <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Program" descriptionTypeRef="http://metadataregistry.org/concept/show/id/1702.html">On Feb. 23, 1987, one of the most violent events since the creation of the universe was observed.  Ian Shelton, a young Canadian astronomer working on a remote mountaintop in Chile, came upon a supernova--the gargantuan explosion in which a star blows itself apart.  A star blows itself apart in a nearby galaxy, and astronomers scramble to study the rare event.  NOVA covers a fast-breaking science story as it is happening. </pbcoreDescription>
